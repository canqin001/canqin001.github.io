Hello and welcome! I'm currently embracing the exciting world of artificial intelligence as a Research Scientist at Salesforce AI Research. My journey is driven by a deep passion for `Generative AI` and `Multi-modal Learning`, with a focus on developing `Video/Image to Text (Understanding)` and `Text to Video/Image (Generation)` techniques.

<!-- with a focus on developing `Foundation Models` and `Autonomous AI Agents` that are not only highly generalized but also multifunctional and controllable. -->

In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. from Northeastern University in Boston, USA. My research during this period was primarily centered around the realms of `Transfer Learning` and `Efficient AI`, where I delved into complex problems and innovative solutions.

Before my Ph.D. journey, I obtained my B.E. degree from Xidian University in Xi'an, China, in 2018. This foundation laid the groundwork for my ongoing pursuit of knowledge and innovation.
