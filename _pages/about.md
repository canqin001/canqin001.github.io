Hello and welcome! Currently, I am working at **Google CoreML**, where I focus on building **Multimodal** and **GenMedia** models, working on systems that can understand and generate across text, image, video, and other modalities. Before joining Google, I was at **Salesforce AI Research**, contributing to multimodal and generative models. I received my **Ph.D.** from **Northeastern University** in Boston, and during my studies I interned at **Adobe** and **Salesforce**, gaining hands-on experience in real-world AI research. I am passionate about the future and want to push the boundaries of what AI can see, reason about, and create.
