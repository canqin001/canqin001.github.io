Hello and welcome! I am currently working at Google CoreML, focusing on building `Multimodal` and `GenMedia` models. Before that, I was at Salesforce AI Research. I received my Ph.D. from Northeastern University in Boston. During my studies, I interned at Adobe and Salesforce, building experience in real-world AI research and applications.
